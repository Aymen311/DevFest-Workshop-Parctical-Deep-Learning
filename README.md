This repository will guide you through the workshop material and all the tools that you need to begin learning. This workshop will cover ML basics that every software engineer should be aware of, the goal is enable everyone with some programming background to dive into ML and build SOTA models.


## Table of Content 

1.  [From Model to Production - Computer Vision](https://github.com/Aymen311/DevFest21_DL_WORKSHOP/blob/main/From_Model_to_Production_Computer_Vision.ipynb) - Presented by Aymene Berriche

      Through this notebook we'll learn how to quickly build a very strong classifier using fastai Library, this won't require having previous knowledge on Deep Learning.
      In this practical session, we're going to use a computer vision example to look at the end-to-end process of creating a deep learning application. More specifically, we're going to build a forest fire classifier! In the process, we'll discuss the capabilities and constraints of deep learning, explore how to create datasets, look at possible gotchas when using deep learning in practice, and more. If you work through a problem similar in key respects to our example problems, we expect you to get excellent results with little code, quickly.
